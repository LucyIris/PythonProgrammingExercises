    "A hydroelectric plant has requested your help in designing a surge tank. You are given the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The average in-flow is                  $Q_{inAv} = 3500$ kg $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ \n",

    "* The fluid is water, with density                $\\rho     = 1000$ kg $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ \n",
    "* The initial water level is              $h_{0}    =   10$ m \n",

You will also need suitable conditionals for performing calculations when the control valve is open/closed, and a conditional for showing your results. **When the control valve opens or closes, you will need to use new initial conditions $h_0$, $t_0$ in future calculations.**)  \n",
